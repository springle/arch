* Ontology

An ontology is a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or
domain that shows their properties and the relations between them. For
architect, as more public datasets become integrated, everything needs
to agree on a common ontology (eg. what describes a person, company,
event, etc). Defining a global ontology is an incredibly subjective
and difficult task, so Arch adheres to the following principles:

- separate the ontology from the rest of the pipeline
- expect constant changes to the ontology, and therefore design for
  backwards-compatibility

In order to achieve these goals, Arch maintains a description of its
"view of the world" in a set of protobufs in the
=src/main/protobuf/=. Read more about protobufs [[https://github.com/google/protobuf][here]]. Arch uses the
proto3 syntax.

Once compiled, these protobufs behave like Scala case classes which
are available to every package within Arch.
